## What is ArchonDev?

ArchonDev is an AI-powered development governance system that prevents your AI coding assistant from making architectural mistakes, forgetting context, and introducing regressions.

**The Problem:** AI coding assistants are powerful but unreliable. They hallucinate, ignore your architecture, forget what they learned, and break things they just fixed.

**The Solution:** ArchonDev adds governance — architectural rules your AI must follow, quality gates before every change, and persistent learning across sessions.

## Two Ways to Use ArchonDev

### 🚀 Full CLI (Recommended)

The complete AI development system with adversarial planning, quality gates, and learning persistence.

```bash
npm install -g archondev
```

Then run:
```bash
archon
```
